# unarchive_file (Data Source)

This only supports **ZIP**, **TAR** and **TAR in GZIP** file now. It supports to use **regular expression** to control which file is **included** or **excluded**.

## Examples

### Extract files from zip file
```terraform
data "unarchive_file" "targz" {
  file_name = "Python-3.11.3.tgz"
  output = "targz"
  type = ".tar.gz"
  includes = ["Object"]
  excludes = ["\\.c"]
}

output "targz_output" {
    value = data.unarchive_file.targz.file_names
}
```

### Extract files from tar.gz file
```terraform
data "unarchive_file" "targz" {
  file_name = "Python-3.11.3.tgz"
  output = "targz"
  type = ".tar.gz"
  includes = ["Object"]
  excludes = ["\\.c"]
}

output "targz_output" {
    value = data.unarchive_file.targz.file_names
}
```

### Nested Schema for `filters`

Optional:

- `excludes` (List of String) inclules specifies which file should not be extracted. It uses regular express to find the files. It is a list
- `includes` (List of String) inclules specifies which file should be extracted. It uses regular express to find the files. It is a list
